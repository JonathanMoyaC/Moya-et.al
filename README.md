# Machine learning models for severity classification and length-of-stay forecasting in emergency units

Length-of-stay prediction and severity classification for patients of emergency units in a clinic or hospital are crucial problems for public and private health networks.  An accurate estimation of these parameters is essential for the better planning of resources, which are usually scarce. Although it is possible to find several works that propose traditional ML to face these challenges, few works have used recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) on raw-text vector representations to improve these predictions. This article assesses the positive impact of incorporating word embeddings, which are functions with which words can be mapped into an n-dimensional vector space, to develop vector transformations of text information for inclusion in traditional machine learning models.  Moreover, we apply a strategy, which is based on Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) values, to provide explanations for these predictions.  The results of our case study demonstrate an increase in the accuracy of the predictions using raw text with a minimum preprocessing of up to six percentage points for the classification of patients according to their level of severity. It increased by an average of two percent the accuracy obtained in the classification of
the patient’s post-care destination and by up to five percentage points for the prediction of the length of
stay in the hospital. In practical terms, if an emergency unit were to make use of these techniques, it could anticipate a patient’s need for hospitalization at the earliest stage of the care process.
